# conversao_real

The purpose of the application is to convert currencies (Real, Dollar and Euro). The application uses the HG Finance API to keep currency values ​​updated and perform conversion based on the stock exchange.

This is my first Flutter project using an API, and although it is simple, I am very happy with the result!
